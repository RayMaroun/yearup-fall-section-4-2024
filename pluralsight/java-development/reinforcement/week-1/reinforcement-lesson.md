# Reinforcement Live Coding Session - Creating a Command Line Application

## Introduction

Today we will be creating a simple command line application in Java that takes user input and prints out some information based on that input. This application will allow us to practice the skills we've learned so far, such as creating variables, using the scanner, declaring methods, and dividing the code into chunks of methods.

## Step 1 - Creating a new project in IntelliJ

1. Create a new Java project called "Reinforcement-lab" using Intellij.

## Step 2 - Adding a new class

1. Add a new class called `MyApplication` to your project.

## Step 3 - Creating variables

1. In your `MyApplication` class, create two variables: one for storing a user's name and one for storing their age.
2. Use the scanner to get input from the user and store it in the variables.
3. Print out the user's name and age.

## Step 4 - Using the scanner with if statements

1. Add an if statement to your code that checks whether the user's age is greater than or equal to 18.
2. If the user is 18 or older, print out a message saying they are old enough to vote.
3. If the user is younger than 18, print out a message saying they are not old enough to vote.

## Step 5 - Declaring methods and calling them

1. Create a new method in your `MyApplication` class that takes a user's name and age as arguments and prints out a personalized message.
2. Call this method from your main method, passing in the user's name and age as arguments.

## Step 6 - Dividing the code into chunks of methods

1. Identify parts of your code that perform distinct tasks, such as getting user input or printing out messages.
2. Refactor your code by moving these tasks into separate methods.
3. Call these methods from your main method to perform the necessary tasks.

## Step 7 - Comparing Strings

13. Add a new if statement to your code that checks whether the user's name is equal to "Alice".
14. If the user's name is Alice, print out a message welcoming her.
15. If the user's name is not Alice, print out a generic message.

## Step 8 - Using if statement with logical operators

16. Add a new if statement to your code that checks whether the user's name is equal to "Bob" and their age is greater than or equal to 21.
17. If both conditions are true, print out a message saying they are old enough to drink.
18. If either condition is false, print out a message saying they are not old enough to drink.

## Step 9 - Using the Math library

1. Add a new method to your `MyApplication` class that takes a number as an argument and returns the square root of that number.
2. Call this method from your main method, passing in a number and printing out the result.

## Step 10 - Using a switch statement

1. Modify the method `printWelcomeMessage`.
2. Add a new switch statement to your code that checks the user's name and prints out a message based on the name.
3. If the user's name is "Alice", print out a message welcoming her.
4. If the user's name is "Bob", print out a message asking him if he wants to grab a drink.
5. If the user's name is anything else, print out a generic message.

## Step 11 - Using boolean variables

1. Create a new method in your `MyApplication` class that takes two integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the first integer is greater than the second.
2. Call this method from your main method, passing in two integers and printing out the result.

## Step 12 - Using the ternary operator

1. Use the ternary operator that checks whether the user's name is equal to "Eve".
2. If the user's name is Eve, print out a message saying she is not welcome.
3. Print out a message saying she is welcome if her name is not Eve.

## Step 13 - Using the Math library (part 2)

1. Create a new method in your `MyApplication` class that takes two numbers as input and returns the larger of the two.
2. Use the `Math.max` function to find the maximum of the two numbers.
3. Call this method from your main method, passing in two numbers and printing out the result.

## Step 14 - Creating a Random Number Generator

1. Add a new method to your `MyApplication` class that generates a random number between 1 and 10.
2. Call this method from your main method, printing out the result.

## Step 15 - Using the Math library (part 3)

1. Create a new method in your `MyApplication` class that takes two numbers as input and returns the smaller of the two.
2. Use the `Math.min` function to find the minimum of the two numbers.
3. Call this method from your main method, passing in two numbers and printing out the result.

## Step 16 - Uploading the code to GitHub

1. Upload the project to GitHub
